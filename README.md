In this exercise I have created two 5 question quizzes, one on javascript and one on html. The user is presented with the option on load to select which quiz they would like to take. Selecting an option begins that quiz. Users are scored on both their speed and their accuracy. On wrong answers players are deducted 15 seconds and 10 points. For a correct answer They get 10 points. Total score is equal to the points plus the time remaining. Highscores are loaded into a list for the player to see.
