In this exercise I have created two 5 question quizzes, one on javascript and one on html. The user is presented with the option on load to select which quiz they would like to take. Selecting an option begins that quiz. Users are scored on both their speed and their accuracy. On wrong answers players are deducted 15 seconds for a wrong answer and awarded 10 points for a correct answer. Total score is equal to the points plus the time remaining.
